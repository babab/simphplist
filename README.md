# Simphplist Framework

A minimalistic MTV / MVC framework for PHP based upon a small set of
components. The main goal is to give developers a simplistic framework
that focuses on fast development of webapps while still giving much
freedom in the way you want to put the ends together.

It relies on the following components:

- M - Model: The model layer is not yet implemented.
- V/T - View/Template: Twig is used for templating and outputing views by default.
- C/V - Controller/View: Controllers are methods of a View class.

The framework is in early development right now and may have many
backwards-incompatible changes between minor versions (0.\*.0) until
version 1.0 is released.

Simphplist Lib helps you with shortcuts and clean API's for writing the
most common idioms when developing web applications in PHP (routing,
validation and $\_GET/$\_POST filtering).

See: http://simphplist.org/ for documentation and examples.


# License

Simphplist is released under an ISC license, which is functionally
equivalent to the simplified BSD and MIT/Expat licenses, with language
that was deemed unnecessary by the Berne convention removed.
