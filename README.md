# Simphplist

Decoupled (framework) libraries with simplistic API's

Simphplist helps you with shortcuts and clean API's for writing the
most common idioms when developing web applications in PHP (routing,
validation and $\_GET/$\_POST filtering).

You can use it as a minimalistic base for writing custom (frameworks
for) applications. Simphplist is carefully designed to allow using it
alongside any other (custom) framework.


See: http://simphplist.org/ for documentation and examples.


# License

Simphplist is released under an ISC license, which is functionally
equivalent to the simplified BSD and MIT/Expat licenses, with language
that was deemed unnecessary by the Berne convention removed.
