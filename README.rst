Paulos
######

Paulos is a PHP Authentication of Users Library and Other Stuff.

It is a mini-framework with anti-framework features or in other words a
collection of losely coupled components that helps you with shortcuts
and clean API's for writing the most common idioms when developing
web applications in PHP (MySQL handling, Simple ORM, Authentication,
Validation, Typechecking).

It is designed to be used as a minimalistic base for writing custom
(frameworks for) applications. Paulos is carefully designed to allow
using it alongside any other (custom) framework.
