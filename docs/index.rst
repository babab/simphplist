Welcome to simphplist's documentation!
======================================

**Decoupled (framework) libraries with simplistic API's**

Simphplist helps you with shortcuts and clean API's for writing the
most common idioms when developing web applications in PHP (routing,
debugging, validation and `$_GET`/`$_POST` filtering).

You can use it as a minimalistic base for writing custom (frameworks
for) applications. Simphplist is carefully designed to allow using it
alongside any other (custom) framework.
